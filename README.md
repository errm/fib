# fib
### An example application that burns CPU.

This is a very simple example application that calucates and returns the n'th
fibonacci number.

It uses a very simple recursive function in order to calcuate the result,
this of course uses lots of CPU when n is higher.

I reach for this application when I want something I can use to test
autoscaling of web applications based on CPU usage.
